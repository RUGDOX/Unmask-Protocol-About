# Unmask Protocol: Backend

A privacy-first,  complex and sophisticated multi-chain backend utilizing multiple modular developer SDKâ€™s for the Unmask Protocol

## Overview

The Unmask Protocol backend is a complete security and identity verification platform for blockchain applications. It provides advanced fraud detection through Web3DNA fingerprinting, secure data vaulting, and an investigative workflow system with court-admissible chain of custody tracking for digital evidence.


## Key Features

- Web3DNA Fingerprinting: Advanced device fingerprinting technology to detect and prevent fraud in blockchain applications (Web3DNA SDK)
- Secure Data Vaulting: Protect sensitive user information with encrypted storage (Vault SDK)
- RugID Verification: Privacy-preserving identity verification system (RugID SDK)
- Real-time Alert System: Immediate notifications for suspicious activities via WebSocket and Mattermost
- Investigation Workflow: Structured process for investigating security incidents (Audit SDK)
- Chain of Custody: Court-admissible digital evidence tracking system (Audit SDK)
- Multi-chain Support: Integration with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Solana, Bitcoin and more
- Access Control: Role-based permissions system for team members
- Dynamic Subdomain System: Client-specific API subdomains with automatic SSL certificate management
- API Request Signing: HMAC-SHA256 signed requests for enhanced security and data integrity
- Custom Rate Limiting: Per-client rate limiting to prevent abuse while accommodating legitimate traffic
- Containerized Deployment: Easy deployment with Docker and Portainer support


## Architecture

The Unmask Protocol backend follows a modular architecture with four main SDKs:

- Web3DNA SDK: Device fingerprinting and fraud detection       --->     (rugdox/web3dna-sdk)
- Vault SDK: Secure data encryption and storage                --->     (rugdox/vault-sdk)
- RugID SDK: Privacy-preserving identity verification          --->     (rugdox/rugid-sdk)
- Audit SDK: Security monitoring and system integrity checks   --->     (rugdox/audit-sdk)

All SDKs are framework-agnostic and can be used in any JavaScript environment (browser or Node.js). The SDKs are available through CDN for easy integration.

## Important Note:  
All SDKs are currently under active development and are not ready for production use.  If you see this note still in a repo readme that mean that it is NOT considered stable.  
#USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Each SDK repo will state the status of that specific SDK.  Please refer to each SDK repo's issues and/or discussions area for updates.
